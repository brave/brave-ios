 * This exists to allow resets after meta/global or crypto/key changes.
 *
 * 'Reset' in this case means that timestamps and progress tracking are
 * discarded: this storage is reconfigured such that all data will be
 * reuploaded, and all data will be re-merged as necessary.
 *
 * This protocol is primarily consumed by `ResettableSynchronizer`, and
 * is invoked when a significant server change is observed â€” changed keys,
 * changed engine elections or syncIDs, or a node reassignment.
