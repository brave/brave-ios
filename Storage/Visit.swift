 * Visit is the model of what lives on the wire: just a date and a type.
 * Ultimately we'll end up with something similar to ClientAndTabs: the tabs
 * don't need to know about the client, and visits don't need to know about
 * the site, because they're bound together.
 *
 * (Furthermore, we probably shouldn't ever need something like SiteVisit
 * to reach the UI: we care about "last visited", "visit count", or just
 * "places ordered by frecency" â€” we don't care about lists of visits.)
